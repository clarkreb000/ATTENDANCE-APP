    <h3>WHY WE ARE HERE</h3>
    <h4> MyAttendanceTracker was started because my wife, who is a teacher, asked me to please build her something that would make tracking her students quick and easy.
        Once I had a system together that she loved, other teachers kept asking her how they could use it too and MyAT was born!
